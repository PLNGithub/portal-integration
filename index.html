    <h1>Portal Integration</h1>
    <p>Documentation on how to integrate an application to Zerone Portal</p>
    <div class="main">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Zerone Portal is an application that act as a portal for other applications registered to it. As such, a user
            can only log in into their applications through portal. If a user logged out from an application, they still
            can access portal and their other applications. But, if user logged out from portal, they will be logged out
            from all of their applications.</p>
        <p>Auth service used in portal (and other applications) is Supabase Auth. The process of signing a user to an
            application will be done by an admin who have the privilege to do so.</p>

        <h3>Integration:</h3>
        <h4>1. Remove Application Login Route</h4>
        <p>With the current implementation, user can only access application through portal. So, if you already built
            a login route, you can remove it.</p>

        <h4>2. Add Route /portal-login/:jwt To Application</h4>
        <p>Of course you can change the :jwt with whatever you like. We will use it to extract the parameter send by
            portal. Make sure this route is public, not inside the application private route.</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-javascript">//App.tsx

    import {Routes, Route} from "react-router-dom";
    import {Portal} from "../path/to/portal-login.tsx"

    < Routes>
        < MyPrivateRoute>
            //...private routes
        < /MyPrivateRoute>

         //...public routes       
        < Route path="/portal-login/:jwt" element={< Portal/>} />
    < Routes/>
            </code>
            
        </pre>

        <h4>2. Create portal-login.tsx file</h4>
        <p>Again, you can name the file whatever you like, tsx or jsx doesn't matter.
            This page will contains nothing but a loading indicator. You
            can use a spinner indicator, or just a loading text like example below.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>//portal-login.tsx

import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useParams, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

//your supabase client
import { supabaseClient } from "../../utility";

function Portal() {
    //this is the params we use earlier
  const { jwt } = useParams();
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetch = async () => {
      //split the url params send by portal  
      //the params contains access_token and refresh_token
      const token: any = jwe?.split("portal-divider");

      //set the session, log the user in
      const { error } = await supabaseClient.auth.setSession({
        access_token: token && token[0],
        refresh_token: token && token[1],
      });

      //you can just look browser's network tab and delete this if statement
      if(error) console.log(error)

      //ask for refresh session, this is to ensure that sessions we got from portal is valid
      const { error: errorRefresh } = await supabaseClient.auth.refreshSession();

      //navigate to main page or your default authenticated page
      //at this point, user is already signed in 
      if (!error && !errorRefresh) {
        navigate("/");
      }
    };

    fetch();

  }, []);
  return (
    &lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;
  );
}

export default Portal;
            </code>
        </pre>

        <h4>3. Authenticate on Every Route</h4>
        <p>Unlike most single-page-app auth implementation. Here, in our portal implementation, we need to check session
            validity in every private route. Don't worry, we don't have to put a function in every route. We only need
            one, and put it in a component which got rendered if route is changing. This component usually is a
            navigation component, like sidebar.</p>

        <pre>
                <code>//Sidebar.tsx
import { NavLink } from "react-router-dom";
import { supabaseClient } from "../../utility";

//example of putting the session check in a navigation component
function Sidebar(){

    const outCheck = async () => {
        //check user session from supabase db
        const { data } = await supabaseClient.auth.getUser();
        const { user } = data;

        //we remove our local session if no user found
        //this means, portal is logged out
        if (!user) {
          /**
          this local storage key-value is set by supabase client
          when we do setSession and refreshSession earlier  
          */ 
          localStorage.removeItem("sb-be-auth-token");

          //this is portal url, we'll discuss this later
          window.location.href = import.meta.env.VITE_PORTAL_URL;
        }
      };
    //call the function
    outCheck();

    return (
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;NavLink&gt;Dashboard&lt;/NavLink&gt;
            &lt;NavLink&gt;User&lt;/NavLink&gt;
            &lt;NavLink&gt;Setting&lt;/NavLink&gt;
            &lt;button&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    )
}

export default Sidebar;
                </code>
            </pre>
        <p>Our session checker now will get called in every route change. And if portal is logged out, then we clear our
            local session, and send user to portal page. Don't worry, the
            function job is just to make an async call to supabase db, it doesn't deal with any state so it won't affect
            performance. If you want to put it inside a useEffect, feel free to do so, just make sure the function get
            called on every route change.</p>

        <h4>4. Adjust SignOut</h4>
        <p>By default, supabase client has a signOut method for signing out a user. But in our implementation, we won't
            use it. Using that method will terminate the session from supabase db. What we want to achieve is that
            application can't terminate session, only portal can. So, if you are using signOut method, you can change it
            to removing the local session only, like below.</p>
        <pre>
                <code>
    function Sidebar(){

        const handleSignOut = ()=> {
           localStorage.removeItem("sb-be-auth-token");
           window.location.href = import.meta.env.VITE_PORTAL_URL;
        }

        return(
           // ...rest of the code

            &lt;button onClick={handleSignOut}&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;

           // ...rest of the code
        )
    }
                </code>
            </pre>

        <h4>5. .env File</h4>
        <p>Add portal url in the .env file. If you use framework other than vite, you can modify according to what you
            use. The URL probably will be changed later when portal deployed to production.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>

VITE_PORTAL_URL=https://portal-c3e94.web.app/
            </code>
        </pre>
